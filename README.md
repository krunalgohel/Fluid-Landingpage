# Fluid Landing Page Design ðŸ”¥

When I embarked on the project to design a landing page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap with a focus on responsiveness, I began by outlining the key elements and objectives of the page. I liked the versatility that Bootstrap offered, allowing me to create a visually appealing layout while ensuring compatibility across various devices. However, I encountered some challenges when fine-tuning the responsiveness for smaller screen sizes, particularly in balancing the placement and sizing of elements to maintain both aesthetics and functionality.
